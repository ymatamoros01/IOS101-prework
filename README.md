## App Brainstorming

  - Provides suggested boards for pins
  
  Natural Reader
  - Export audio files to mp3
  - Adjustable reading speed, volume, and voice type
  
  Goodnotes
  - Ability to sync audio with written notes
  - Can search written and typed text

App Idea

  An app I would like to build is Pokemon Study. The vision for this project is to create a study tool 
  which promotes focus and productivity for extended periods of time by gamifying the learning/studying 
  experience. The application will feature 2 modes for different forms of studying: Pomodoro and a digitized
  version of Leitner System. Users who accomplish studying tasks will be awarded with new Pokemon and/or evolution 
  of their current Pokemon. Thus, users will be able to track their study progress by checking in on their Pokemon 
  via a Pokedex which provides stats. 


## Challenges
The main challenge I faced was running the simulator, as my current MacBook didn't have enough RAM to handle it. 
I had to borrow another device with higher specifications to complete the task.
